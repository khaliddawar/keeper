# Sprint 1: Foundation Infrastructure
**Duration:** Weeks 1-2  
**Theme:** "Get the Pipes Working"  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish core development infrastructure and authentication foundation

## ðŸ“‹ **SPRINT BACKLOG**

### **Story 1: Foundation Infrastructure Setup**
- **Priority:** High
- **Complexity:** 7
- **Estimate:** 3-4 days
- **Assignee:** TBD
- **Status:** Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose with Postgres + pgvector
- [ ] Configure Redis for job queues
- [ ] Set up FastAPI base application
- [ ] Implement database schema (notebooks, tasks, users, memories)
- [ ] Environment configuration and secrets management
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Write local development documentation

### **Story 7: Authentication & User Management**
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Complexity:** 7
- **Estimate:** 3-4 days
- **Assignee:** TBD
- **Status:** Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement Telegram auth verification endpoint
- [ ] Set up JWT token generation and validation middleware
- [ ] Create User model with telegram_id, timezone, locale
- [ ] Implement protected route middleware
- [ ] Frontend auth state management with Zustand
- [ ] Login/logout flows with token persistence
- [ ] User session management and refresh logic

## ðŸŽ¯ **SPRINT SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Must Have (Definition of Done):**
- [ ] Docker Compose environment fully operational
- [ ] Database schema deployed with all required tables
- [ ] Telegram authentication flow working end-to-end
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation functional
- [ ] All health check endpoints responding (200 OK)

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Basic error logging system
- [ ] Development seed data
- [ ] API documentation started

## ðŸš¨ **RISKS & MITIGATION PLANS**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Docker/DB setup complexity | Medium | High | Allocate extra buffer time, prepare simpler fallback |
| Telegram auth integration issues | Low | Medium | Have backup simple auth ready |
| Environment configuration problems | High | Medium | Create comprehensive setup documentation |
